Hostname / UUID lookup are now available on the Hastur REST service. This
is a precursor to the proxy being able to do automatic translation.

New hosts may not show up in the lookup for 5-10 minutes since there's a
scheduled job that runs every 5 minutes to update the lookup row.

Sharp eyes will notice that when you ask for a UUID's hostname you actually
get a few different names. This is because very few networks actually
manage to keep the FQDN / hostname / nodename in sync. All three are buggy
in various scenarios, so we just return all 3.

Most people at Ooyala use the "cnames" field for display.

Where available, EC2 public / internal hostnames overwrite fqdn / hostname,
In the "gandalf" example below, all three of fqdn/nodename/hostname are
different (the system hostname is modified to match the cname on this machine,
which is discouraged).

The cnames array should contain all cnames for a host. The order is:
  * /etc/cnames in the order it is on the host
  * DNS info in the order it was seen in the zonefile

/etc/cnames is the canonical location Ooyala ops supports for specifying a
human name and is set up on most hosts now. Hastur agent fetches this file
daily and sends it with agent registrations, that are used in building this
data.

The v2 retrieval service adds the ability to post messages through
HTTP.

The initial API is to post to /v2/insert_message.  The "details" param
should equal a JSON message in standard Hastur format, including UUID,
type, labels and so on.

To get messages of this type, query them from Hastur or use the client
and override deliver_with.
